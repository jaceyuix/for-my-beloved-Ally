 mo ba when me no no believe in love because idk too many people are so no real so overtime I don't believe in it anymore and
 nag b-build lalo my overthinking and bumaba self-esteem that's why it's hard to trust people anymore kaya I don't believe in 
it ever since kaya wala pa me naging gf beb and hopefully it will you, please please and all of that negativity of believing in 
what's hard to believe or too good to be true, somehow you proved them that love can be real and I believed it again because of 
you bebi, and you proved it soo so so much, you made me so much better as person beb, Iloveyousomuch for believing in me and fighting for us two,

and parang naiiyak me because when I read the lyrics for the first time and napanood yung music video I'd imagine our future na we would be there 
in our rainy nights or lonely days. and I'd always promise myself to be better for you everyday and please promise me we will stay together forever my only love.
I do remember when the first time asking you sa call ng a 'silly question' na do you think na we could be more than friends, beb pati ako na surprise
 but I guess that is our push up to push us? (wow) I feel so relieve that I don't have to hide my feelings anymore and finally say the world I sincerely 
wanted to say 'Iloveyou' (naiiyak na aq omg) just like the lyrics said 'my only one, when I see you I want to lean on you, I want to have you a love like this would make
even the most immature dream come true.'
I just love loving you so much, ly. you make me make me love you so much more everyday.  I can't wait to see you, my only one.">

      <div class="song-card" data-message="beb HSHSWHAHAHA 😭 this song when I hear this song it's very very relating beb kasi whenever I compliment you, you don't believe me pero I mean it so so much when I look into your eyes in your pictures, it's like stars are spawning sa house namin beb? and just like I always said bebi even tho I don't see you everyday, I know you look so beautiful every single passing day. 
and babyy you're perfectly as you are and I love youuu so much and beb btw I wrote this before pa for you, I never stopped making poems connected to you, beb :)) .
                              
whenever the world see you,
it just stops and stares
on how beautiful you are,
beyond all dreams and prayers.

no diamond holds the sparkle,
no song can quite compare,
to the laughter that you carry
and the love you choose to share
                       
so don’t you ever wonder,
don’t question who you are,
to me, you’re every miracle,
my heaven’s brightest star.
                         
and if the world should ask me
why I love you this way,
I’d say it’s because you’re perfect
in every breath, every day.
                         
Iloveyouuu :P">
